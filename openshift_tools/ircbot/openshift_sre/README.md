### Channel Monitoring

Monitored channels have the follow features:

* Approximately 10 minutes *before* a defined shift change, the following message will be displayed

  > {curr_shift} preparing to sign off, {next_shift} preparing to take over the environment
  > {curr_nick}: What happened today? What does {next_nick} need to know about?
  > Check SNOW ticket queue here {queue}

* Approximately 15 minutes *after* a defined shift change, the following message will be displayed

  > Shift change complete
  > Shift Lead: {curr_nick}
  > On-Call: {oncall_nick}
  > Thanks {prev_shift}, enjoy your evening!

* The channel topic will be updated following a shift change with the following message

  > Current Shift Lead: {lead} - OnCall: {oncall} - Shift Change at: {time}UTC (Brisbane - {time}; Beijing - {time}; Brno - {time}; Raleigh - {time}

* If a monitored channel is mentioned within its own channel, the `.shift` command will be called
* If a monitored channel has *any* IRC traffic on the weekend, it will display the following message (**NOTE** This message is not displayed more than once every 10 minutes)

  > This channel is unmonitored on weekends. If you have a sev 1, submit a SNOW ticket to page the  on-call SRE ({oncall}). Submit your SNOW ticket at {url}

## SNOW Ticket parsing

Any SNOW tickets detected in a message will reply with an automatic link to the SNOW ticket
